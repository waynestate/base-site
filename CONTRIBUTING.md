### Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

* We require [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to be used with your IDE to take advantage of the project's `.editorconfig` settings.
* PSR-2 Coding Standard - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to run `make phplint`, which uses [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/pint).
    * It will use the `pint.json` file within the project to tailor to our code styling.
